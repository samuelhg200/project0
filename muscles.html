          <h3>What is so great about swimming?</h3>
          <div>
          <p>
            Swimming is one of the most exhausting sports due to its naturally demanding nature,<br>
            is obvious when you consider that most of your time swimming is spent without the <br>
            ability to breath, which is considered quite essential in most other sports. Curiously<br>
            enough, breathing too much could make you lose time, spinning your head to take a sip<br>
            of air will most probably result in you increasing your body friction causing you to <br>
            lose some precious milisenconds. Abusing your ability to breath can turn out to be <br>
            horribly detrimental in a race! This is one of the things that make swimming such a <br>
            hard sport to domain. Finding the adequate frequency of strokes, finding the exact<br>
            frequency of breaths which allow you to stay strong without losing speed, finding<br>
            the best way to position your body and adapting this based on the length of the race <br>
            or the style you are going to swim. Mastering this underlying complexity is what allows<br>
            the best swimmers, well, to be the best swimmers.<br>
